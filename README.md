The following Python modules additional to the normal Python installation are needed to run the calculator. In the development versions it is necessary to install them manually. 

| Module | How to install |
| - | - |
| readkeys | `pip install readkeys` |
| keyboard | `pip install keyboard` |

In the Release versions there will be an automatic installer for these modules or they might be contained in the installed program already.
